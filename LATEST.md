Initial Alpha Release
- still in early alpha
- does not work on coop
- merging algorithm itself may not produce predictable results, especially dealing with camos and lead popping power
- should be fully compatible with modded towers/ modded towersets, as well as paths++
- heroes are experimental and are not balanced at all in terms of cost
- wizard lord pheonix loves to spawn infinite pheonixs
- geraldo doesnt work
- merged towers should be saved within the map save

Big thanks to @doombubbles for his ultimate crosspathing algorithm, which was used here
